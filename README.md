The Superstore dataset is a rich and comprehensive dataset containing information on the sales, 
orders, and customers of a fictional superstore. The dataset which was collected from kaggle provides a detailed view of the 
business operations of the superstore, including information on the products sold, the customers 
who purchase them, and the sales performance across different regions and categories with about 9,994 rows of data
spanning four years (2014-2017),With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, a Superstore Giant is seeking your knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments they should target or avoid.
In this report, I perform python-based exploratory data analysis to gain insights about the 
fictional superstore.
